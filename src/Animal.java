// if there is a interface we should provide the body for interface methods using a

//if we are not providing the body for any one method then that class will become 
//abstract class

// one interface can not implement another interface
//but one interface can extends another interface

// one interface contains any no.of implementation classes
// one class can implement any no.of interfaces(i.e; multiple interfaces).
// we can not create an object to interface but we can create a reference.
// we can create object its implementation classes.
	// we can declare variable
	// value of declared  in the interface variable can not be changed

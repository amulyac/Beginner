// java is  a programming language
		//OBJECT
	// object have state and behaviour
//Software objects also have state and behaviour

//software object state is stored in field
//software object behaviour is shown via methods
//in s/w development methods operate internal state of objects 
//object to object communication will done via methods
		//Class: it describes the behaviours/states of the object of its type support
		//class is blue print which creates new object
		//class is model to represent the object
		
		//public class Dog{
		
		// class can contain variables
		
		// variables are 
		//1.local variables,: these variables are declared with in the method it destroy
		//once the method has finished
		  
		//ex;public static void Run(){
		
		//int i= 100; // local variable which exists inside the  function
	//}
		
		//2.global variables ,:
		//which are non static variables we can use the variable entair program public
		// word will give scope to variable to act as global variable 
		//there is no separate global variable in java
		//3.static variables ,: these are nothing but class variables declared with the class
		//with a static key word
		
		
		
		//instance variables :
		//these variables declared inside the class but out of any method 
		//ex; 
		//public class Dog{
		//String color;
		//int age
		
		
		
		//public static void main(String args){
		
		//}
		//}
		
		
		// a class can have any number of methods
		
		//ex;
		//public class Dog{
		//int age;
		//String color;
		
		//void barking(){
	//}
		//void Sleeping(){}
		
		
		//CONSTRUCTORS
		
		// constructor which will initialise the object
		
		// every class has a constructor
		// if we don't write the constructor the class explicitly java 
		// compiler will create default constructor for class
		
		//every time each object is created must one constructor invoke
		// the main rule of the constructor is that should the same name of the class
		// a class can have more than one constructor
		   
		
		//passbyvalue and pass by reference by swap
		// this. mod key word 
		
		//Accesses Specifiers:
		
		
		//we have 4 types of accesses specifiers in java
		
		//Accesses specifier is used to  specify how to access the members of a class
		//1.private : scope of private variable is with in the class
		//private members of a class will not  available to same packageclass
		//as well as otherpackage class.
		//2.public : scope of public specifier is global
		// public members of a class will available to same pakage as well as other package
		//3.protected : member available to same package class
		//also available to other package class in case  of inherittance
		//4.default: default member of aclass available in with ipackge
		
		//POLYMORPHISM
		//some exists in various forms then it is called  polymorphism
		//If one method may have different actions then it is called polymorphism
		// in polymorphism we have two methods those
		
		//overloading
		//overriding
